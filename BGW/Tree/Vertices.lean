# Vertex addresses in depth-first order

The root address is `[]`. Each child contributes its vertex addresses prefixed
by its zero-based child index. Thus equal child subtrees still contribute
distinct vertex occurrences.

The depth of an address is its list length. For valid vertices, prefix ancestry
includes equality; strict ancestry uses a proper prefix. The parent of a
nonempty vertex address is obtained with `List.dropLast`.
