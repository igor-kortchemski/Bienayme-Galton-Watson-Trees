# Reconstruction from depth-first outdegrees

Read a natural degree word from right to left. At a vertex of degree `d`,
the first `d` trees already reconstructed become its ordered children.
The decoder fails if fewer than `d` trees are available. A tree word must
leave exactly one tree; an empty word represents the empty forest only.
