# First passage at forest component boundaries

An ordered forest is encoded by concatenating its component increment sequences.
Its path first reaches minus the number of components at its terminal time.
More generally, the end of the first `r` components is the first visit to `-r`.
The statements use finite prefix sums and include the empty forest.
