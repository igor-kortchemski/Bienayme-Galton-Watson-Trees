# Finite plane trees

A plane tree is a finite rooted tree whose children are ordered. We use Mathlib's
`WType`, with `Fin n` indexing the children of a vertex of outdegree `n`.
`PlaneTree.node` and `PlaneTree.children` provide the list interface. The `induction`
and `cases` tactics produce a single `node ts` case, and `PlaneTree.fold` defines
functions by bottom-up recursion, so the `WType` encoding is not used outside this file.

Addresses are zero-based lists of child indices; the root has address `[]`.
These are implementation coordinates, independent of the paper's one-based
numbering of vertices in depth-first order. Size counts vertices, including the root.
